Bromite is only available for Android Marshmallow (v6.0, API level 23) and above.


Flux is an innovative browser that seamlessly integrates traditional web browsing with cutting-edge blockchain and Web3 capabilities. It allows users to not only browse the internet securely but also interact with decentralized applications (dApps), manage cryptocurrencies, execute smart contracts, and leverage the benefits of decentralized networks.

🚀 An official release is desirable : June 15, 2025 🚀

🌍 Why Choose Flux?
Traditional browsers rely on centralized servers, making users vulnerable to censorship, data breaches, and tracking. Flux changes the game by providing a decentralized internet experience where privacy and security are the top priorities.

🔑 Key Features
🔹 Built-in Crypto Wallet
Full support for major blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and more).

Securely store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.

Robust encryption for private keys and multi-signature authentication.

🔹 Web3-Ready & Seamless dApp Integration
Direct access to decentralized applications without requiring third-party extensions.

Connect effortlessly with DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and blockchain-based games.

Native support for Ethereum, Polygon, and other Web3 ecosystems.

🔹 Decentralized Identity & Authentication
Password-free authentication using blockchain technology.

Use decentralized identities (DIDs) for secure logins without centralized databases.

Protection against phishing attacks and password leaks.

🔹 Enhanced Privacy & Security
No tracking or data collection – your browsing history remains yours.

End-to-end encryption for all internet interactions.

Blockchain-based DNS protection against domain spoofing and censorship.

🔹 Smart Contract Execution & Blockchain Interactions
Execute and interact with smart contracts directly from the browser.

Effortlessly use DeFi protocols, DAOs, and token swaps.

Read and verify smart contract details before signing transactions.

🔹 Ad-Free & Censorship-Resistant Browsing
Built-in ad blocker for a clean, distraction-free experience.

Access decentralized websites (IPFS, Arweave, Handshake) without restrictions.

Full freedom from government and corporate censorship.

⚙️ How It Works
Decentralized Browsing – Instead of relying on centralized servers, Flux connects to distributed networks like IPFS, Arweave, and blockchain nodes.

Integrated Wallet – A non-custodial wallet built into the browser allows users to manage digital assets without third-party apps.

Seamless dApp Experience – Easily interact with blockchain applications for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and more.

Privacy & Security First – No trackers, no third-party data collection, and fully encrypted connections ensure safe browsing.

🔥 Why Flux Stands Out
✔ Full Control Over Your Data – Unlike traditional browsers, Flux does not rely on centralized servers.
✔ Seamless Web3 Experience – No need for separate extensions like MetaMask; everything is built-in.
✔ Decentralized & Censorship-Free – Browse the internet without restrictions.
✔ Optimized for the Future of Web3 – Native blockchain and smart contract support.
